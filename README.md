### Hi there 👋, I'm Seun 'Banwo — an iOS developer 📱👨🏾‍💻.

> Don't comment bad code – rewrite it – Brian Kernighan.

#### About me 🤔:

I’m a product-aware iOS engineer who understands the need for tested, resilient code balanced against the need to move fast and iterate.
I am passionate about  platforms and always looking at opportunities to widen my knowledge. 
You'll find here several repositories where I test different ideas, architectures and patterns. 
Don't let the graph fool you. I code almost everyday but push mostly to bitbucket. 
Feel free to reach out if I can help with anything at all.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning SwiftData (if you're from the future this was 2023...)
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate on open source projects and projects that impact a lot of lives
- 🤔 Given the ever-evolving nature of the iOS platform, I am committed to continuous improvement. You can't catch me idle. 
- 💬 Ask me about iOS, Swift, MacOS
- 📫 How to reach me: [X (formerly twitter)](https://twitter.com/seun_banwo), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwaseun-adebanwo)
